                <h3>To infinity and beyond - Neil deGrasse Tyson (Author), Lindsey Nyx Walker</h3>
                <p>
                    The book begins as we leave Earth, encountering new truths about our planet’s atmosphere,
                    the nature of sunlight, and the many missions that have demystified our galactic neighbors.
                    But the farther out we travel, the weirder things get. What’s a void and what’s a vacuum?
                    How can light be a wave and a particle at the same time? When we finally arrive in the blackness
                    of outer space, Tyson takes on the spookiest phenomena of the cosmos: parallel worlds, black holes,
                    time travel, and more.

                <h3>The Celestine Prophecy - James Redfield</h3>
                <p>
                    In the rain forests of Peru, an ancient manuscript has been discovered.
                    Within its pages are 9 key insights into life itself -- insights each
                    human being is predicted to grasp sequentially; one insight, then another,
                    as we move toward a completely spiritual culture on Earth.
                    Drawing on ancient wisdom, it tells you how to make connections among the
                    events happening in your life right now and lets you see what is going to
                    happen to you in the years to come. The story it tells is a gripping one of
                    adventure and discovery, but it is also a guidebook that has the power to
                    crystallize your perceptions of why you are where you are in life and to direct
                    your steps with a new energy and optimism as you head into tomorrow.

                <h3>Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision (The Celestine Prophecy Book 2)- James Redfield</h3>
                <p>
                    The exciting sequel to The Celestine Prophecy transports you through portals into other dimensions
                    . . . to memories of other centuries . . . to the moment before our conception . . . to the passage
                    of death and the life review we must all face . . . and to the love-filled Afterlife. As you grasp
                    the Tenth Insight, your understanding will expand to include a sense of the special mission that we
                    all share. And you will begin to answer, as never before, the unspoken questions in every human heart:
                    Why are we here? What are we to do? Where are we going?
                </p>
